### Unfixed Bugs

During the development of the project, I had some bugs and some I could not solve, such as being able to insert my website to create the Responsive Mockup, the Am i responsive website https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https:// 8000-leonardocar-thedublinso-k6axp3qvbeh.ws-eu47.gitpod.io/, didn't work on my site, so I don't present the responsive mock up of the project.
I had an absurd difficulty in working with media queries, and I think I must have started to style it the wrong way, at that point I had a lot of difficulty developing

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
